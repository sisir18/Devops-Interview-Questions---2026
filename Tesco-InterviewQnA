1)How would you migrate application from public subnet to private subnet?
Migrating an application from a public subnet to a private subnet in a cloud environment (like AWS, Azure, or GCP) is essentially about tightening security by removing direct internet exposure. Let me break it down step by step:

🔑 Key Steps for Migration
Assess current architecture

Identify which components (EC2 instances, containers, databases, etc.) are in the public subnet.

Document dependencies: inbound/outbound traffic, ports, and external integrations.

Create private subnets

In your VPC, define private subnets that do not have a route to the Internet Gateway.

Ensure they are spread across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.

Move application servers

Launch new instances (or migrate existing ones) into the private subnet.

Update Auto Scaling Groups, ECS/EKS tasks, or VM configurations to use private subnet IDs.

Enable outbound internet access via NAT

If the application needs to download packages, call APIs, or reach external services, configure a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance in a public subnet.

Update route tables so private subnets send outbound traffic through NAT.

Configure inbound access

Since private subnets cannot be reached directly from the internet, use:

Load Balancer (ALB/NLB) in a public subnet to forward traffic.

Bastion host in a public subnet for admin SSH/RDP access.

VPN or Direct Connect for secure corporate access.

Update DNS and networking

Point your domain (Route 53, Cloud DNS, etc.) to the load balancer instead of the public instance.

Adjust security groups and NACLs to allow only necessary traffic.

Test thoroughly

Validate application functionality, external API calls, and monitoring/logging.

Run penetration and connectivity tests to confirm no unintended exposure.

Decommission old public resources

Terminate instances in the public subnet once migration is complete.

Remove unused Elastic IPs, Internet Gateway routes, and security group rules.

⚖️ Benefits of Migration
Improved security: No direct internet exposure.

Controlled access: Only via load balancers, bastion hosts, or VPN.

Compliance: Meets stricter regulatory requirements.

Scalability: Easier to add more private subnets across AZs.
2)What is the security implementation that you have done in CICD as well as your application running on EKS?
3)Application hosted on EC2 is not able to connect to RDS.How would you troubleshoot?
4)Write a bash script to give the status of the pipelines in your Organization.It should print success or failure?
5)Write terraform script to provision EC2 instance and security group?
6)How would you ensure EC2,S3,RDS are used as per requirements?
7)Lets say POD is went to Cashlookbackoff .How would you troubleshoot.Give detailed explanation?
8)Write a docker file for python flask?
